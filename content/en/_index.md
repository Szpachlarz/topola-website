<p class="lead mt-5">Topological (rubberband) router for printed circuit boards</p>
{{< blocks/link-down color="info" >}}

{{% blocks/lead color="primary" %}}
Topola is an open-source topological (rubberband) router for printed circuit boards (PCBs). Unlike traditional maze routers, topological routers like Topola are not constrained by a grid or 45Â° angles, allowing for more efficient circuit board layouts (denser arrangement of components and traces, lower crosstalk, reflection, and electromagnetic interference). The goal of the project is to develop a dutifully maintained engine for interactive and automatic routing that can be used both as a standalone application and reusable software library integrated in popular open-source PCB electronic design automation (EDA) packages, giving designers a tool for developing high-quality open hardware designs without having to pay for expensive proprietary software.
